The Ministry of Transportation of The Kingdom of Far Far Away has come up with a revolutionary idea: implementing a centralized information system for all the roads in the country. The system requires live updates for the following information:
-- the total distance on all practicable roads in the country 
-- the "on-the-road" diameter of the country 
-- travel directions for the shortest path between any two cities in the country 

The roads are registered as a list of direct, uninterrupted roads between cities (i.e, if the way from city A to city B passes through city X, the list will record (A,X,20km) and (X,B,15km), and not (A,B,35km)). The distance of each such direct road is also stored. The roads are not directed - i.e., the distance from A to B is the same as the distance from B to A. 

The system has to run in real-time: due to accidents or road-work, the list of practicable roads keeps changing, but the information service should always be up to date. Thus, a competition has been started for the fastest solution one can provide for such a on-line system.
